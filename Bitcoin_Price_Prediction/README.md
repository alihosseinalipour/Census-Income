To download the dataset, use the following link:

In this project, we rewrote the code available at the above link. We used the "feature_engine" library to impute our dataset and remove outliers. The simulation results show that removing outliers will decrease our model's Mean absolute error significantly. 
Furthermore, we use "sklearn.pipeline" in "bitcoin_price_prediction_UsingPipeline.ipynb" to assemble several steps, shorten the code, and make it easier to read and adjust.
